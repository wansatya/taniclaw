        - "Check and adjust pH daily (target 5.8-6.2)"
        - "Monitor water level and top up as needed"
        - "Ensure good oxygenation (air pump in DWC)"
        - "Maintain 16 hours light / 8 hours dark cycle"
        - "Temperature: 18-24°C"
    - name: harvest
      duration_days: [7, 21]
      description: "Continuous harvest of fast-growing hydroponic greens"
      instructions:
        - "Harvest outer leaves for continuous production"
        - "Flush with clean water 1-2 days before harvest"
        - "Harvest in early morning for best quality"
        - "Deep-clean system between growing cycles"

watering:
  default_frequency_days: 0

  weather_adjustments:
    high_temp_threshold: 30
    high_temp_action: "increase cooling and monitor dissolved oxygen"
    low_humidity_threshold: 40
    low_humidity_action: "increase reservoir water and mist surroundings"

fertilizer:
  schedule:
    - stage: germination
      type: "Hydroponics nutrients A+B (half strength)"
      frequency_days: 7
      amount_grams: 3
      note: "Mix A and B separately before combining"
    - stage: vegetative
      type: "Hydroponics nutrients A+B (full strength)"
      frequency_days: 7

diseases:
  common:
    - name: "Root Rot (Pythium)"
      symptoms: ["brown slimy roots", "wilting despite water", "foul smell from reservoir"]
      prevention: ["maintain good aeration", "keep reservoir cool (<22°C)", "use beneficial bacteria", "clean system between cycles"]
    - name: "Nutrient Deficiency"
      symptoms: ["yellowing leaves", "purple stems", "slow growth"]
      prevention: ["check and adjust EC regularly", "ensure correct pH for nutrient uptake", "use complete nutrient formula"]
    - name: "Algae Growth"
      symptoms: ["green slime in reservoir", "on growing medium", "in pipes"]
      prevention: ["block all light from nutrient solution", "use dark opaque containers", "clean system regularly"]
    - name: "Fungus Gnats"
      symptoms: ["small flies around growing medium", "larvae in substrate"]
      prevention: ["use coco coir or rockwool instead of soil", "yellow sticky traps", "allow top to dry between watering"]

harvest:
  indicators:
    - "Leaves are full-sized and vibrant green"
    - "For lettuce: heads are compact and full"
    - "For herbs: before flowering begins"
  days_after_flowering: [0, 0]
  notes: "Hydroponics grows 2-3x faster than soil. Monitor EC (1.5-2.5 mS/cm) and pH (5.8-6.2) daily. Change nutrient solution every 1-2 weeks."
