lifecycle:
  stages:
    - name: seed
      duration_days: [5, 10]
      description: "Seeds planted, waiting for germination"
      instructions:
        - "Plant seeds 0.5-1 cm deep in seed tray"
        - "Keep soil consistently moist"
        - "Ideal temperature: 20-25°C"
        - "Cover with plastic bag to maintain humidity"
    - name: germination
      duration_days: [7, 14]
      description: "Seedlings emerging, first true leaves forming"
      instructions:
        - "Remove plastic cover"
        - "Provide bright indirect sunlight"
        - "Thin seedlings — keep strongest one per cell"
        - "Water gently using spray bottle"
    - name: vegetative
      duration_days: [21, 35]
      description: "Strong root system and foliage developing"
      instructions:
        - "Transplant to larger pot or garden when 15-20 cm tall"
        - "Full sun 6-8 hours daily"
        - "Install support stake early"
        - "Water deeply 3-4 times per week"
        - "Pinch off suckers for indeterminate varieties"
        - "Apply balanced fertilizer every 2 weeks"
    - name: flowering
      duration_days: [14, 21]
      description: "Yellow flowers appearing, fruit setting"
      instructions:
        - "Switch to low-nitrogen, high-phosphorus fertilizer"
        - "Maintain consistent watering — irregular watering causes blossom drop"
        - "Gently vibrate flowers to aid pollination"
        - "Avoid watering leaves directly"
    - name: harvest
      duration_days: [20, 45]
      description: "Fruits ripening and ready for harvest"
      instructions:
        - "Harvest when fully colored (red, orange, or yellow depending on variety)"
        - "Pick regularly every 2-3 days"
        - "Remove any diseased fruits immediately"
        - "Reduce watering slightly to concentrate flavor"

    - name: "Blossom End Rot"
      symptoms: ["dark sunken spot at blossom end of fruit"]
      prevention: ["consistent watering", "add calcium to soil", "avoid over-fertilizing with nitrogen"]
    - name: "Tomato Horn Worm"
      symptoms: ["large chunks eaten from leaves", "presence of green caterpillars"]
      prevention: ["hand pick caterpillars", "attract parasitic wasps", "use Bt spray"]
