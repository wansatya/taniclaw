diseases:
  common:
    - name: "Tip Burn"

      prevention: ["consistent watering", "ensure calcium availability", "improve air circulation"]
    - name: "Bottom Rot"
      symptoms: ["soft brown decay at base", "foul smell"]
      prevention: ["avoid waterlogging", "improve drainage", "reduce fertilizer"]
    - name: "Slugs and Snails"
      symptoms: ["large irregular holes in leaves", "slime trails"]
      prevention: ["use copper tape barriers", "beer traps", "diatomaceous earth around plants"]

harvest:
  indicators:
    - "Head is firm and compact (for heading varieties)"
    - "Outer leaves are large and deep green"
    - "Harvest before bolting (flower stalk formation)"
  days_after_flowering: [0, 7]
  notes: "Lettuce bolts quickly in heat. Grow in partial shade during hot months. Ideal for hydroponic systems."
