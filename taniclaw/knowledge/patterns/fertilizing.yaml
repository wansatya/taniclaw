fertilizing_patterns:
  general_principles:
    - "Always water before fertilizing to prevent root burn"
    - "Follow the rule: less is more — under-fertilization is safer than over-fertilization"
    - "Organic fertilizers release slowly and are safer for beginners"
    - "Chemical fertilizers work faster but require precise measurement"
    - "Signs of over-fertilization: yellow leaf tips/edges, crusty white deposits on soil"

  npk_guide:
    nitrogen: "N — promotes leaf and stem growth. High in vegetative stage"
    phosphorus: "P — promotes root, flower, and fruit development"
    potassium: "K — promotes overall plant health, disease resistance, fruit quality"
    interpretation:
      "16-16-16": "Balanced all-purpose for general growth"
      "10-30-20": "High phosphorus — for flowering and fruiting"
      "20-10-10": "High nitrogen — for leafy vegetables"

  organic_alternatives:
    compost: "Rich in micronutrients, slow-release, improves soil structure"
    worm_castings: "Excellent all-purpose, gentle — cannot burn roots"
    fish_emulsion: "High nitrogen, fast-acting, good for vegetative stage"
    banana_peel_tea: "High potassium, good for fruiting"
    coconut_water: "Contains cytokinins, promotes root growth"
    wood_ash: "High potassium and calcium, raises soil pH"

  application_methods:
    soil_drench: "Dissolve in water and apply at base — best absorption"
    foliar_spray: "Diluted solution on leaves — fast uptake but temporary"
    dry_granule: "Sprinkle around drip line, water in — slow release"
    side_dressing: "Apply along row, mix into top soil"

  safety_limits:
    max_frequency_days: 7
    max_amount_grams_per_plant: 20
    safe_concentration_percent: 0.5
